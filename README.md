## Introduction
Sales data plays a vital role in understanding business performance and customer behavior. Analyzing pizza sales helps identify popular products, peak ordering times, and revenue contribution across different categories. This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data using SQL, Python, and Power BI to generate actionable, data-driven insights that support business decision-making.

---

## Dataset Overview
The dataset is stored in a SQL database and consists of the following tables:
- **orders** – order date and time details  
- **order_details** – quantity of pizzas ordered  
- **pizzas** – pizza size and price information  
- **pizza_types** – pizza names and categories  

The relational structure allows detailed analysis using joins and aggregations.

## Project Overview
The main objectives of this project are:
1. To analyze overall sales performance and revenue trends.  
2. To identify top-selling pizzas, sizes, and categories.  
3. To study customer ordering behavior based on time and date.  
4. To calculate revenue contribution by pizza category and type.  
5. To build interactive dashboards and analytical reports.

The same business questions are analyzed using **Power BI and Python**, both connected to the same SQL data source.

## Data Cleaning
To ensure data accuracy and reliability, the following steps were performed:
- Verified data consistency across all tables  
- Handled missing or invalid values  
- Removed duplicate records  
- Standardized date and time formats  
- Ensured correct data types for numerical and categorical fields  

---

## Data Exploration and Insights
- **Sales & Revenue Analysis:** Total orders and total revenue calculation  
- **Product Performance:** Highest-priced and most ordered pizzas  
- **Size & Category Analysis:** Demand analysis by pizza size and category  
- **Time-Based Trends:** Hourly and daily order distribution  
- **Revenue Contribution:** Percentage contribution by pizza category  
- **Cumulative Revenue:** Revenue growth over time using window functions  

Advanced SQL concepts such as joins, subqueries, aggregations, and window functions were used.

## Dashboard
Power BI is connected directly to the SQL database to create interactive dashboards.  
The dashboard highlights:
- Total revenue and total orders KPIs  
- Top-selling pizzas and categories  
- Hourly and daily sales trends  
- Size-wise and category-wise distribution
